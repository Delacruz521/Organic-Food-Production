        <h3>The following are the aim of the Organic Food Production</h3>
        <h1></h1>
        <p>• Organic foods often have more beneficial nutrients, such as antioxidants,
            than their conventionally grown counterparts.</p>
        <p>• Produce food while establishing an ecological balance to prevent soil
            fertility or pest problems.</p>
        <p>• Organic products reduce public health risks to farm workers, their families,
            and consumers by minimizing their exposure to toxic and persistent 
            chemicals on the farm and in food.</p>
        <p>• To reduced risk of certain chronic diseases such as cardiovascular and
            neurodegenerative diseases and certain cancers.</p>
