        <h3>Recent Project</h3>
        <h1></h1>
        <p>• While food producers adhere to crucial safety regulations to save consumers from 
            sickness, many organic farms encounter insurmountable financial challenges and 
            other challenges while trying to meet food safety requirements.</p>
        <p>• The Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research (FFAR) and the Organic
            Center collaborated to examine research priorities within the organic community.</p>
        <p>• The Organic Center collaborated with Professor James Galloway’s team at the
            University of Virginia to investigate the effect of different farming systems on 
            nitrogen pollution.</p>
        <p>• The Organic Center is collaborating with the Sustainability and Health Initiative 
            for Net Positive Enterprise (SHINE) at the Harvard School of Public Health on a 
            research project looking at the net-positive benefits of organic on climate change.</p>
        <p>• The Organic Center is compiling scientific literature into a comprehensive report
            that highlights the environmental, animal welfare and human health benefits of 
            organic meat.</p>
        <p>• The use of synthetic chemicals in conventional farming has skyrocketed over the
            last decade, causing a cascade of environmental and human health problems.</p>
